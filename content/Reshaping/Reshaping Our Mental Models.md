## Reshaping Our Mental Models

At work, I learned that in every process there are actually three processes: the actual process, the process people think is going on, and the ideal or improved process.

We have mental models of how things work, many of which are sort of installed within us by the racial capitalist patriarchy, and we need to bring them to the surface and uninstall the ones we don't want.

Otherwise the default is: Work harder! Work more consistently! Be more efficient!
Do these things actually work? And if so, are they actually the solution for us right now?
