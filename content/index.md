# (RE)MODEL YOUR WRITING PROCESS: 100 Experiments In Getting Unstuck

After I had a baby, everything I thought I knew about writing failed me. Get up early. Morning pages. A ritual. Sitting quietly.

I thought I was blocked. I thought maybe I wouldn't be able to do any serious creative work until the kid started school.

That wasn't true.

I'd gotten all kinds of advice on writing--from how to freewrite to how to revise, how to use index cards, how to breathe--and nothing seemed to work.

What I hadn't learned was the skill of experimenting with my writing process. I'd heard what worked for a bunch of other people, but I hadn't cultivated the tools to think critically about what would work *for me, at this time in my life.*

When I started to think about it this way, the tools and experiments were all around me. In thinking about what would work for me, I could borrow from process improvement, or philosophy, or even comedy.

The more I focused on getting to know myself and discerning what would work for me, the easier things became.

So here's the resource I wish I'd had a long time ago.

I'm writing this in public, so it's a work in progress.
